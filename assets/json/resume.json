      "summary": "Reversi, also known as Othello, is a strategy board game for two players played on an 8x8 uncheckered board. The game uses 64 identical game pieces, called disks, which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing one disk on an empty square, with their assigned color facing up. When a player places a disk on the board, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled. Reversi was most recently marketed by Mattel under the trademark Othello. The game gained considerable popularity in England at the end of the nineteenth century and was patented in Japan in 1971 by Goro Hasegawa. The name Othello was selected by Hasegawa as a reference to the Shakespearean play Othello, the Moor of Venice, and the green color of the board is inspired by the image of the general Othello, valiantly leading his battle in a green field.",
