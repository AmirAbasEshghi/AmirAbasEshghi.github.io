In this post, we want to know about your interests in old cars.<br />
Which of these cars do you think is more beautiful and attractive?

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/post/car1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn
</div>

You can see now two beatiful old cars that named `Jaguar E-Type` and `Corvette Stingray c1 1957`

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/post/car2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/post/car4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

And the last car that plays with your emotions and may change your mind is `Bugatti 57SC 1936`:

        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/post/car3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>
