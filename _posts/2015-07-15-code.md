This code writes the smallest common multiple of two numbers :<br />
Least Common Multiple `LCM` is The LCM of two numbers is the positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. For example, the L of 15 and 20 is 60, and the LCM 5 and 7 is 35.

To find the LCM of two numbers, you can use the following formula:

LCM(a, b) = (a x b) / GCD(a, b)

where GCD(a, b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of the two numbers.


```C++
#include <stdio.h>

int bmm(long long int a, long long int b, long long int i);

int main()
{
    long long int num1 , num2 , lcm , result , c;
    
    scanf("%lld %lld",&num1,&num2);

    if (num1>num2)
        c = num2; 
    else
        c = num1;
    
    result = bmm(num1,num2,c);

    lcm = ((num1*num2)/(result));

    printf("%lld",lcm);
}

int bmm(long long int a,long long int b , long long int i)
{
    if ((a % i == 0) && (b % i == 0))
    {
        return i;
    }
    else
    {
        i--;
        bmm(a,b,i);
    }
}
```
