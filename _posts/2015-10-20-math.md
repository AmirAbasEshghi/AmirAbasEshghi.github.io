This post is to introduce you to the sweetness of mathematics and to its beauty while being difficult.
By clicking on the name of site [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/), you can see some examples of different math sections.


To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
$$
