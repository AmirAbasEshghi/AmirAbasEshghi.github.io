This project involves designing and implementing a system that allows users to control various aspects of their home, such as lighting, temperature, and security, using a mobile app or web interface. 
The system would use a combination of hardware (e.g. microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators) and software (e.g. embedded systems, networking, and mobile app development) to create a fully automated home.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
</div>


Features:

1. Control lighting: Users can turn on/off and dim/brighten lights in different rooms of the house.

2. Control temperature: Users can adjust the temperature in different rooms of the house using a smart thermostat.

3. Control security: Users can monitor and control access to their home using smart locks and security cameras.

4. Automation: The system can be programmed to perform certain actions automatically based on user preferences, such as turning off all lights and appliances when the user leaves the house.
